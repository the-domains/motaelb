To be King or Queen of the beach, a 'baller needs to combine the explosive power of a 100m sprinter, the balance of a free runner and the endurace of a mountain biker, whilst keeping up with the best football and basketball stars in the world when it comes to athletic ability. Here's why you should look at this sport in a whole new way.</p><p><strong>Want more beach volleyball? Start with <a href="http://www.redbull.com/en/stories/1331749912989/watch-the-best-beach-volleyball-moments-of-2015">the best action clips of the season here</a>, and follow up by</strong><strong><a href="https://us.swatchmajorseries.com/en/229">watching the championship live</a>in Fort Lauderdale, Florida from </strong><strong>Oct 2–4.</strong></p><h3>Beach volleyball players would dwarf most of the NBA</h3><p><strong>Key number:</strong>2.11m<br><strong>What:</strong> The height of Brazil's Evandro Goncalves and Dutch duo Christiaan Varenhorst (pictured) and Michiel van Dorsten – all playing the FIVB World Tour.<br><strong>How it compares:</strong>They'd all make the top 10 tallest players in the NBA right now.</p><p>Forget basketball, real giants play in the sand. The tallest beach volleyball player ever? That's USA's Ryan Doherty, whose massive 2.14m (7'1") frame is bigger even than that of NBA's San Antonio Spurs shooter Tim Duncan. And with a 2.18m (7'4") wingspan, he's pretty handy at blocking, too. Put it this way, he could easily carry your door – the long way. </p><h3>Their vertical jump is higher than Cristiano Ronaldo’s</h3><p><strong>Key number:</strong>106cm.<br><strong>What:</strong>The vertical jump of USA's Sean Rosenthal.<br><strong>How it compares:</strong>A whole 30cm higher than Real Madrid's anti-gravity superstar Cristiano Ronaldo's best leap.</p><p>A beach 'baller jumps on average 300 times per game – and these are no ordinary jumps, as you can see in this video of Brazil's Alison Cerutti defying physics to hang high and hit the perfect spike against USA. When the sand is your arena, every day is leg day, and with the net standing some 2.43m high for men and 2.24m for women, these pros need superhuman spring to rule the beach. Next time you're on the sand, try it out, with no shoes or run up, to see whether you really have hamstrings of steel.</p><h3>They can jump reach as high as Kobe Bryant</h3><p><strong>Key number:</strong>4.0m (12'0").<br><strong>What:</strong>The size of USA's Phil Dalhausser's massive jump reach.<br><strong>How it compares:</strong>That's a whole 24cm higher than an NBA basketball hoop.</p><p>Ever wondered why boxers go running down the shore before a big fight? It's because every move in the sand is tougher than a move in the gym. You use up way more energy, your core fires up as you try to balance, and your feet slip and slide, which makes Olympic gold medallist Dalhausser's stats even more incredible. Maybe he could teach Kobe a thing or two – after all, basketball players often take their jump training from the boards to the beach for that very reason.</p><h3>Their serves are three times faster than Usain Bolt</h3><p><strong>Key number:</strong>114kmh (71mph).<br><strong>What:</strong>The fastest serve ever recorded in FIVB World Tour history.<br><strong>How it compares:</strong>It's equal to the maximum speed of a cheetah.<br>The focus in Germany's Olympic gold medallist Julius Brink's face says it all – in this game, everything begins with a serve, and used right, it can be the deadliest weapon in a baller's arsenal. Just ask Russian Igor Kolodinsky – the world record holder. He smashed a serve so fast at the Italian Open that it matched the speed of one of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's unstoppable strikes. There's a reason that he and his partner, Dmitry Barsouk, are nicknamed 'Barsouk and Bazooka'.</p><h3>They make more passes than football players</h3><p><strong>Key number:</strong>1,038.<br><strong>What:</strong>The average number of touches per beach volleyball player per game.<br><strong>How it compares:</strong> More than the total number of passes when Bayern Munich faced Barcelona in the 2015 Champions League (1,021).<br>Having a bad day on the court? Deal with it. There are no substitutions in this game, and the rallies can be relentless. The lengthiest single ball battle of the 2015 FIVB World Tour so far? An epic 22-touch duel between China and Argentina womens' pairs. Annnnnnd breathe.</p><h3>They hit balls the height of a five-storey building</h3><p><strong>Key number:</strong>20.0m (65').<br><strong>What:</strong>The highest shot ever played in beach volleyball.<br><strong>How it compares:</strong>That's 10 LeBron James' stood on each other's shoulders.<br>Yep, it's not all about speed. There are drop serves, jump serves, and roundhouse serves, all designed to bamboozle opponents and draw gasps from the crowd. Oh, and sky balls, like this smash from Italy's Adrian Carambula – which went so high, it almost came down with snow on it. His trademark move took him two years to perfect and regularly leaves his rivals clutching thin air.</p><h3>Their post-workout regime is tougher than your workout</h3><p><strong>Key number:</strong>8°c.<br><strong>What:</strong>The temperature of a pro beach 'ballers post-workout ice bath.<br><strong>How it compares:</strong>Swimming in the Arctic Ocean… naked.<br>All of this athleticism takes its toll, and so the carefully-planned pre and post-game recovery regime of a sand monster is just as unforgiving as their time in battle. With every joint and muscle on fire after a day on the court, a mega stretching session is key, before a plunge into a freezing cold ice bath. "It's the worst part," winces USA's blond-mohawk man, Casey Patterson, lowering himself in. "We're in here five days a week."</p><h3>They can play for 25 hours non-stop</h3><p><strong>Key number:</strong>25 hours, 29 minutes.<br><strong>What:</strong>The longest marathon playing beach volleyball, secured by Germany's Mateusz Baca, Sebastian Lüdke, Tomasz Olszak, and Wojciech Kurczynski.<br><strong>How it compares:</strong>The same time as a flight from London to Sydney.<br>Yep, you read that right: you could turn on the TV in England, watch the first set of this game, jump on a plane, fly halfway around the world, fall asleep on the guy next to you, watch three movies, eat some microwaved airplane food, read a book cover to cover, step off the plane, check into your Australian hotel – and watch the final set. Now if that's not epic, I don't know what is.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="17"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="19"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="20"><span data-reactid="21"><!-- react-empty: 22 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="23"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="24">8 stats that show why beach volleyball is the best</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="27"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
